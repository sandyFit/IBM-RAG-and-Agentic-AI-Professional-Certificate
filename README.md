# 📘 IBM RAG and Agentic AI Professional Certificate

I’m currently working through IBM’s **RAG and Agentic AI Professional Certificate**, an 8-course program focused on building real-world AI applications. My goal is to strengthen my practical skills in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **multimodal AI**, and **agentic systems** while applying these techniques in hands-on projects.

---

## 🧑‍💻 What I will be Learning

* How to design **modular and reusable GenAI workflows** using LangChain
* Building **RAG pipelines** with vector databases and embeddings for context-aware applications
* Creating **autonomous AI agents** with LangGraph, CrewAI, and AG2
* Integrating external tools and APIs to extend the capabilities of AI systems
* Applying **multimodal AI** for text, image, and audio use cases

---

## 🛠 Projects I’ll Complete

As part of the program, I’ll work on practical projects that simulate real-world use cases, including:

* Developing **prompt engineering techniques** with LangChain
* Building AI applications that combine **LLMs and retrieval**
* Setting up **Gradio interfaces** for interactive apps
* Running **similarity searches** with Chroma Vector DB
* Creating a **data visualization agent**
* Completing a **capstone project** that pulls everything together

---

## 🎯 Why I’m Taking This

I’m pursuing this certificate to:

* Get structured, hands-on practice with **RAG and agentic AI workflows**
* Build a portfolio of projects that showcase **practical AI engineering skills**
* Explore multiple frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, LangGraph, CrewAI, AG2, MCP) and compare their strengths
* Prepare myself for opportunities where **AI and software development intersect**

---

## 🌱 My Next Steps

By the end of the program, I aim to:

* Have a **portfolio of applied AI projects**
* Be comfortable working with **retrieval pipelines, multimodal inputs, and AI agents**
* Share what I build along the way — both the successes and the challenges — as part of my learning journey
